# thingsboard-widgets
New widgets for ThingsBoard IoT platform.

* _chart-future-timestamps.json_ --> This widget allows to plot a chart with values related to **future timestamps**, with a fixed time window. Can be useful when you need to plot forecasts of trends.
* _chart-stacked-with-separate-negative-positive.json_ --> This widget integrates a **chart.js library** widget in ThingsBoard. It allows the user to plot a stacked chart which is different from the ThingsBoard standard one since it can keep separate the negative and positive values, avoiding to sum them when stacking.
* _gauge-temperature-analog.json_ --> Analog gauge for temperature (or other type of data) which is way more configurable than the ThingsBoard standard gauges. It is an example of the integration of **gauge.js library** in ThingsBoard.
